As you put together your career, you’re bound to ruffle a few feathers. You’ll need to learn how to wade through office politics to get things done, but you should never do something just because you’re afraid of being fired. There are always exceptions to this rule, but you learn those exceptions when you develop your skills for reading people.

Keep a schedule, create task lists and execute them, and do everything you would do if you had a job. When you walk into an interview with the glow of someone who has a task to complete, you’ll change your interviewer’s demeanor. You cannot fake confidence. If you’re putting out resumes and scheduling interviews, then that kind of confidence comes out when you sit down and talk to a hiring manager. If you’re looking for a job but are currently working, then don’t act like you’re sneaking around. Stand tall and give strong handshakes when you walk through the door of a hiring manager to talk about your next career move.","author":"Aftab Uddin","created_date":"2020-04-10T12:56:59+06:00"},{"id":2,"title":"Stop being loyal to your company","short_description":"In many instances, it’s almost unfair how companies perceive their employees.

An employee that does just enough to keep his job and maintains an acceptable level of productivity is actually seen as disposable. Your company is only loyal to you as long as you offer value to the company. Who should you be loyal to in your career pursuits? You should be loyal to yourself. Is it in your best interest to move on to a new company and seek out a new challenge? If you feel it’s time to move on, then make the move. Of course, you should show respect for your employer and gratitude for having a job. That should be a given. But you don't need to go out of your way to show loyalty to a company that could replace you tomorrow.","author":"Munir Uddin Ahm","created_date":"2020-03-11T12:56:16+06:00"},{"id":1,"title":"Focus on professional success before looking for h","short_description":"It sounds weird to tell someone that they shouldn’t seek happiness in their job, but it really is a","description":"It sounds weird to tell someone that they shouldn’t seek happiness in their job, but it really is a great piece of advice.
